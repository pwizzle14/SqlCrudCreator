# SqlCrudCreator
Author 
Dominic Davis


Summary
This application creates C# class objects and basic CRUD sql quries based on a table in MS SQL database, in short 
this is a home built ORM. One can use this program to manage the data access layer of an application, as an alternative to more common
third party solutions like Entity Framework. This application uses barebones(as barebones as possible :-) ) C# which has 
the advantage of being easily upgradable/ compatible with different versions of c#.

All other applications can use this by using the SqlCrudCreator object.

This application is created as a portfolio item to which is demonstrate working knowledge of tecnologies listed in my resume. It is and probably always will be a work in progress.
